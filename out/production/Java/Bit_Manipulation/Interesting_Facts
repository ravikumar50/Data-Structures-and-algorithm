1. If there are two consecutive numbers lets say x and x-1, and let us consider the postision
   of the last set bit of x. Now before this position all the bits of x and x-1 will be same and from
   this position to the last all the bits in these numbers will be different

   Now when we will take &(and) between these number that is x and x-1 then the bits which are same
   while be there but all the different bits will become 0. This will eleminate the last set bit of x.
   Now let us consider the new number as 'a' which comes from x & x-1
   Now take a & a-1 , this will eleminate last set bit of a.
   Now do this process untill the number becomes 0, this will give you the number of set bits
   in the number x.
