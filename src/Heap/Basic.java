    Full Binary Tree - All Nodes must have either 0 Or 2 child
    Complete Binary Tree - All level must be full expect the last level
                           Last level must be filled in left to right manner

    Heap - It is a Complete Binary Tree
           It is stored in the form of Array
           Some formula

           Left child = (2*i+1)
           Right child = (2*i+2)
           Parent Node = (i-1)/2

           Two types of Heap

           Min Heap - Parent Node have value less than its both child
                      This is valid for all the Nodes

           Max Heap - Parent Node have value greater than its both child
                      This is valid for all the Nodes
